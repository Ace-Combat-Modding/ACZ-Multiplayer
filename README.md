# ACZ Multiplayer
An experimental multiplayer server for Ace Combat Zero.

This tool works by reading memory values for useful data (position, health, ammo, etc) from PCSX2 through Pymem and replicating it to the other players. A version for Ace Combat 5 is intended for the future.



Roadmap:
- Figure out basic data transmission
- Enable LAN and internet play
- Implement PvP dynamic
- Implement mision co-op
    - Figure out NPC state synchronization
